# Introduction 
The website has a lot of functionalities as can be expected, however for the purpose of this
challenge, we’ll only be focussing on the “Plan a journey” widget also known as “Journey
Planner”.
The widget is accessible from the TFL Homepage or by clicking the “Plan a journey” tab from the homepage.

# Getting Started
Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process : Install the necessary nuget packages and selenium pre-requisites.
2.	Software dependencies: Nuget packages update and matching the packages is enough to cover the dependencies.
3.	Latest releases: Just the test version uploaded as part of the software test.
4.	API references: Open API for tfl website

# Build and Test
Build the soluton to identify the tests which are outlined:
1. Verify valid journey can be planned using the widget
2. Verify the widget is unable to plan a journey when no locations are entered
3. Verify the widget is unable to provide results when invalid journey is planned
4. Verify that the jouney can be amended using the Edit Jouney button
5. Verify change time link on the journey planneer displays "Arriving" option and plan a journey based on arrival time
